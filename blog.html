   				I had enough familiarity with HTML to get through this fairly quickly, I had to look up the specifics for the image tag,
   				and some minor details, but I was actually surprised by how much I remembered. The HTML learning sites were a great overview
   				to look over and covered almost everything that I had to cover
   			</p>
   			<p>
   				I am mildly familiar with git, but I have used other version control systems easily.
   				After a skim through of the basics, I was good to go.

   				Signing up for piazza was easy, and it looks to be a valuable resource that I look forward to using.
